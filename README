Debian Security Analyzer
------------------------

debsecan, the Debian Security Analyzer, is a tool to generate a list
of vulnerabilities which affect a particular Debian installation.
debsecan runs on the host which is to be checked, and downloads
vulnerability information over the Internet.  For details, see the
debsecan(1) manual page.

The vulnerability database is maintained by the Debian testing
security team:

  <http://secure-testing-master.debian.net/>

A web interface to the database is available at:
