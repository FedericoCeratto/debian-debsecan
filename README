Debian Security Analyzer
------------------------

debsecan, the Debian Security Analyzer, is a tool to generate a list
of vulnerabilities which affect a particular Debian installation.
debsecan runs on the host which is to be checked, and downloads
vulnerability information over the Internet.  It can send mail to
interested parties when new vulnerabilities are discovered or when
security updates become available.

For details, see the debsecan(1) manual page.  For instructions how to
create a suitable, randomized cron entry, see the
debsecan-create-cron(8) manual page.

The vulnerability database is maintained by the Debian testing
security team:

  <http://secure-testing-master.debian.net/>

A web interface to the database is available at:

  <http://idssi.enyo.de/tracker/>

WARNING: debsecan is still a bit experimental.  As usual, use it at
your own risk.

Known issues
------------

Removed packages result in confusing reports (see test case 005).
